        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>You can make this sandwich for your family and serve it alongside coleslaw or potato salad.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
            <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained</li>
            <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>8 slices pastrami</li>
            <li>1/4 cup margarine, softened</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread dressing onto one side of each bread slice. Top 1/2 of the slices with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and pastrami, then top with remaining bread, dressing-side down. Spread margarine on the outside of each sandwich.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Grill sandwiches in the hot skillet until bread is golden brown, fillings are hot, and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
